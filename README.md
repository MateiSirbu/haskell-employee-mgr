# employee-mgr

## <img align="right" src="./README/haskell-logo.png"> Synopsis 

Just a basic employee manager written in Haskell during the Functional Programming course of UniTBv; nothing more, nothing less. This tool can read from and write to CSV files, aggregate and display relevant information in an orderly fashion using the [ansi-terminal](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ansi-terminal) package.
